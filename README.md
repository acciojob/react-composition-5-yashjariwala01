# React Composition 5

Create a Tabs component that accepts a tabs prop. 

Tabs prop should be an array of objects with title and content properties. 

The component should render a list of clickable tabs with the title of each object. 

When a tab is clicked, the corresponding content should be displayed below the list of tabs. 

Add the ability to have multiple sets of tabs on the same page by allowing the Tabs component to accept a key prop that will be used to distinguish between different sets of tabs.
